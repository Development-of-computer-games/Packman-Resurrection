## Processes:
In the first 30sec of the game the user will recieve a notion of the past, games we used to play as kids.
The player will see:
  - The monsters - obstacles that they will need to face.
  - Where are the points they need to get in order to win the level.
  - How can they gain abilities to face obstacles.
The game will be atractive and simple, and will give the player the feeling like they know what to do in order to complete the level.
As the levels gets harder, the user will feel the challenge raising and the will to continue playing.
At the core of the game the player will need to face monsters, find the best path in order to avoid them and gain the points in order to complete the level.
In order to finish the level, the player will need to recieve the goal points, once they do that, they will continue to the next level which will be more challenging.
In order to move in the game, the player will use to arrow keys, possibly the space too (when they recieve special abilities).
- Arrow up - walking up , climbing up .
- Arrow down - walking down, climbing down.
- Arrow left - walking left.
- Arrow right - walking right.
- Space - using special abilities, depends on what we cought, will appear on the screen, we gain them by choosing the best way to walk there and obtain them.

## Rules:
The rules are simple, avoid monsters and collect points.
The rules will be well explained in the rules lable in the main screen which will explain all the various options of the game, game-flow, buttons and abilities.
- Walking inside the boundries of the game.
- Passing obstacle.
- Use abilities that we own.
- All rules will be determines and explained before each level.

## Recourses:
- Special abilities, points , bad-path which will fine the player.
- The recources will be spread on the area of the game.
- The recourses will give the user special abilities in order to pass the level \ will give them extra points.
- The map will be designed from easy to expert. The resources will be spread by level of expert and will give the user the feeling of a challenge.
- All the recourse will appear on the screem, sometimes they will dissapear (the user will recieve a msg in advanced), furthermore the player will see the list of recourses that at their disposal.

## Conflicts:
- The player will need to pick the best path in order to recieve points and abilities.
- The player will need to avoid monsters.
- The player can travel only where there is a path.
- The path in the game will be hard to manuver and will be desiged from level of easy to expert in order to create challenging game.
- The player can choose multiplayer mode, which they will fight against each other.
- The player can choose multiplayer mode and fight together against the computer.
- The player will need to face dillemas as where to walk, which path is the best, which ability will give the most power, which points are more rewarding.

## Boundries:
The world will be mostly closed, there will be several spots where the player can transport from a certain spot to another and add another aspect of creativity.
The map will be flat.
The boundries will be explained at the beggining of the level, and the spots of teleportation will be marked.
The map will be designed in a way that the path a player picks has a meaning and diffrent outcomes.
The player can travel around and get from a certain spot to another, note that if the player get stacj in a corner, and the monsters are circling him\her, they are exposed to losing, therefore there is an importance of the choices they make.

## Outcomes:
- There is only one outcome - win \ lose.
- Both luck and skill take place, the skill is to understand which path to take, the luck take place at how many monsters will come at ur way, how many abilities one will recieve to their disposal.
- In the singleplayer mode - if you get killed \ not recieving the points needed for thee level - you lose.
- In the multiplayer mode - the players can choose either to gain forces against the computer or to be against eachother in a win\lose game.

## Market survey:
We believe that this version was already invented, we came across few games that tried to do what we offered, and some did exactly.
We believe we can make a newer version with additional upgrades that will take this game to the next level!
